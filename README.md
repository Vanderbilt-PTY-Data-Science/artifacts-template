Identifying whether a particle is a remnant of ancient stone tool-making activities
# context
Ancient towns had specific areas where they constructed stone tools. Stone knappers would work at an area where they had all of their tools to construct stone blades and surfaces. This area generally became the center of commerce for these towns. Therefore, by identifying if particles are from stone-making activites, we can determine where exactly towns had their areas of commerce.
# method
To accomplish this, we must analyze the data from each particle and use R studio to control the data in such a way that it can yeild information about where it is from and what type of material it is.
